pore anatomy: http://insidewood.lib.ncsu.edu/menu/type/modern?2
3      Wood ring-porous
4      Wood semi-ring-porous
5      Wood diffuse-porous
Look for Species traits.xlsx (currently in treegarden/budexperiments/input ... but I imagine it is elsewhere also, just with hidden columns) for the pore data
